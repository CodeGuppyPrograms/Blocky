We hope you are... because in this tutorial we will learn how to create “Blocky” – the very simple image editor that allows you to create your own characters pixel by pixel.

No magnifier glass required - just your mouse!

Feel free to personalize and extend the pixel editor as you with. You can add features such as color selection and various drawing tools.

Also, don’t forget to check the "Color Blocky" - the more advanced version of this editor, with color selection.
